##INPUT / OUTPUT FORMAT

###INPUT
	* The first line contains three integers n, l and k.
	* n is the total number of stations.
	* l is the number of stations which have station masters.
	* k is the maximum number of stations by which a station master can move.
	* The next l lines contain the position of the station master originally (which are less than n).
##OUTPUT
	* The first line of output gives the minimum distance (which is optimized to be maximum) between two station masters.
	* The next l numbers give the position of each station master after 'post election tranfers'.
##CONSTRAINTS
	* L < N <= 10^5
	* N,K and L are positive integers
